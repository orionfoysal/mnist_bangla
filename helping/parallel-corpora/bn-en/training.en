That's why the Complex number z is thought as a point in the cartesian coordinate, so the x of cartesian coordinate = Re (z)is x axis and in the same way y=im(z) is y axis.
A complex number z, hence, can be thought as a point on Cartesian Coordinate. In Cartesian Coordinate, the x axis of the complex number is x=Re(z) and similarly y=Im is y axis.
So a complex number plain z can be called as a point in the Cartesian Co-ordinate. The complex number in the Cartesian Co-ordinate x = Re(z) is x axis and in the same way y = lm(z) is y axis.
thus a complex is seen as a point on cartesian plane here x=Re(z) is its x-axis and y=Im(z) is its y axis
