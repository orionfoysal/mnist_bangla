Parallel corpora for 6 Indian languages created on Mechanical Turk 
==================================================================

This tarball contains data sets for Bengali, Hindi, Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu and Urdu.   Note that every source segments was translated redundantly by four different Turkers.   We ensured that the training, test and dev sets were non-overlapping (none of the sets contain the same source segment). The dictionaries were created in a separate HIT.  You're welcome to append them to the end of the training data when you compile a translation model.  

Here are the sizes of the different sets:

Since the data was created by non-expert translators hired over Mechanical Turk, it's of mixed quality.
